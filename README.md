# stats_class_assignment
For this project the task was to apply everything we have learnt over the last 8 week in the stats class to four different datasets. The maths and stats involved ranged from creating basic histograms and scatter plots to implementing machine learning clustering. One of the main tasks was deciding what different statistical models were applicable to each dataset. In the first part in scenario 1 and 2 the main task was choosing what would be the best ANOVA model to use given the assumptions of the data. Another one of the tasks that was more difficult to get around was the missing data in the first dataset, while it may be your first inkling to just drop all the rows with missing data it was important to consider whether this was advantageous to the future analysis. For the dataset I decided that because over 5% of the data was missing that it would be best for me to input the data. There were many challenges to overcome in the tasks and choices to make about what statisitical models would be best fit for the data.
